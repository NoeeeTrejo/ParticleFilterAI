# ParticleFilterAI
an AI that tracks pixels that have the most change

## Purpose: 
I took a class about simulations, so I decided to make a simulation of a random walk, but using particle filtering which something I learned in my AI class. 
I applied some filters to reduce noise, and used cv2 to read in the video!
