# ParticleFilterAI
an AI that tracks pixels that have the most change

## Purpose: 
A final project for my [environmental simulations class](http://militzer.berkeley.edu/EPS109/final_projects_2021/index.html). Here's the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FEEKu_STTbI99l2QLSr_Ezcfd_h79WmXB8WK1_8kIIg/edit?usp=sharing)!
I took a class about simulations, so I decided to make a simulation of a random walk, but using particle filtering which something I learned in my AI class. 
I applied some filters to reduce noise, and used cv2 to read in the video!
